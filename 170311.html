  <h3>Organizing student-run tech events</h3>
  <p>
  Today is the first day of <a href="http://w17.hackuvic.com/>HackUVic</a>, an annual hackathon held at UVic, put on by 
  UVic WebDev. It's also the second last day of <a href="https://itch.io/jam/resistjam">ResistJam</a>, an annual Game Jam
  that is online-based, but is nonetheless being held at UVic on the 3rd floor (today is Saturday, but it's been running all week.)
  I've been spending most of my free time and energy on these events for the past three weeks.
</p><p>
  For HackUVic, I'm co-lead organizer, alongside lead organizer Brynn Hawker and co-leads Jake Cooper, and Dominique Charlebois.
  The four of us banded together a little more than two weeks ago after the previous organizer stopped communicating with everyone.
  With only two weeks to get funding, food, volunteers, and a venue, we split responsibilities amongst each other and got to work.
  I've handled food, beverages, and t-shirt orders (design was Brynn), and I also found $800 of sponsorship from two local companies.
  I've been putting up posters and doing classroom visits as well. 
  Finally, I've been in constant communication with my three team members.
</p><p>
  For ResistJam, I made a few classroom visits, organized my club (UVic GameDev Club), and kicked off the event on Monday with Pizza 
  and team-making exercises.
</p><p>
  My reason for organizing these events, even when I could be doing other things, is to strengthen my network with other UVic students,
  and to see what kind of talent is out there as far as students are concerned. I'm always interested in students who are doing something 
  out of the ordinary - Be it strong design and CSS, low-level software, interesting backend code and devops, or any complex software 
  that they did all of the work on. I usually don't find it, but when I do, it really piques my interest. Hard things are hard, and when 
  a student does some cool software on his own for no reason other than to learn, I am massively impressed.
</p><p>
  When I spend my time on organizing these events, I am not doing complex software on my own. It's upsetting because 
  the only way that I can create value as a developer is by cranking out code that solves problems and is maintainable, 
  and that task requires both the ability to manage complexity and having software design foresight that comes from 
  building many large systems. Building large systems is a slow, methodical process where the developer focuses deeply on
  how the mental model of his solution and on the problem arena. In short, it is an exercise in learing. 
  We think about the principles and truths of the problem domain and of our solutions until they are so familiar that insights arise 
  effortlessly. 
</p><p>
  In organizing, the bulk of the work is communicating and managing relationships. There is just no way to hit this kind of focus when 
  you're constantly context switching: I am talking to sponsors, now I'm talking to teammates, now I am designing a logo, now I'm going 
  to print off posters and put them up, now I am speaking in front of an audience of 50 people about our event. Frankly I don't know if 
  this kind of work is teaching me anything. It's not helping me deeply focus on hard software problems. It's not really building my 
  software portfolio.
</p><p>
  Speaking to my teammate Jake Cooper yesterday, I expressed this concern. He said that events like ResistJam and HackUVic have a multiplier 
  effect: If I put in 20 hours of work, perhaps it equates to 100 hours of work for each student that attends and learns something in 10 minutes 
  that would have taken hours to learn on their own. So maybe it's a matter of putting in my time to the community to keep this ball rolling.
</p><p>
  With that said, I think I am going to be taking a hard break from organizing events for couple of months.
