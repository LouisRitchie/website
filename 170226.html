  <h3>Writing HTML & CSS time-consuming and strenuous</h3>
  <p>
  In my last <a href="170218.html">blog post</a>, I recorded an FFmpeg command I had used to concatenate some .mp4's.
  The purpose was to create a video compilation of what happened during Global Game Jam, to be used in a thank-you 
  webpage sent to each of the event's sponsors. And holy crap, did making that website take some time - and I'm not 
  inexperienced in crafting & serving entire sites by hand.
</p><p>
  Writing the HTML and linking the fonts/scripts took less than an hour, writing the CSS took probably around three hours, 
  and getting everything to look decent on a myriad of displays took <strong>another</strong> two-three hours. 
  I had to configure FFmpeg to create the videos, and that was about an hour. Once I completed the stand-alone pages, 
  I had to serve them from victoriaggj.com; I spent at least a half-hour fiddling with nginx configs before going the 
  easy route and putting the *.html that I wanted to serve in my home directory. I finally got the pages up, and the 
  full screen background videos were loading very inconsistently - Sometimes they would play on the first go, sometimes 
  they would not, but they always seemed to stop working after a hard refresh. I worked around this by uploading to YouTube 
  and providing a link to that video the page.
</p><p>
  All in all, I spent around 10 hours on the project. I would not do it again. It's just not interesting or fun to do
  this kind of stuff, and my hands ache after typing for 10 hours straight trying to get these thank-you pages out the door. 
  While the skill of making a pretty page and putting it on the internet is useful, and focusing 
  on computer work for long periods is a good thing to practice doing, HTML and CSS simply has no virtue.
</p><p>
  Obviously, though, it's valuable to thoroughly understand HTML and CSS for doing web development inside of 
  slightly-more-virtuous front end frameworks. I would rather be writing React than pure HTML and CSS, and having 
  written a slew of CSS recently will definitely help me crank out decent UIs.
