I'll be meeting up with the folks from UVic Aero tomorrow. Their club focuses on
autonomous flying drones, which is a great area to study right now. I've been 
looking at the PX4 drone software stack, and I thought I ought to dive into it 
when I found time, but joining a club is going to be a much easier way to learn 
about drone software.
</p><p>

UVic Aero has a slack channel that I was able to easily join. I expressed interest 
in writing code for them, and they set me up on their Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket
sites. Chris from UVic Aero expressed that they have some web clients for their 
drone that need rewriting. Currently, they are written in Backbone JS, but they're 
looking to move their frontend code to React+Redux (no suprises here). They have 
a ton of other technology in their stack, and I'd rather get my hands dirty with 
the other stuff, but I need clout with this club first. Since I know React+Redux
quite well, I should be able to bang out some new web clients for them really 
quickly.
</p><p>

There are two other guys who have expressed interest in writing code for the club,
and by the sounds of things, they'll be joining me on the web client rewrite project.
I'm glad to have people join me. It would be nice if we could 
become a formidable team together. It's always great to write code with an involved 
and ambitous team.

Last weekend I worked on a Twitch viewbot detector with William Grosset. 
The basic idea was to type a channel name, and our code would find and point out the 
viewbots. That was a 
great time. Will wrote the first bit of code for the client side, making async calls 
to twitch's api. The problem with that was that it would run waay too slow when you 
queried a channel with a large number of viewers. I convinced will that we should be 
making the client a shell that simply talked to a server that was doing all of the 
work. He agreed. I upgraded my Digital Ocean server from $5/month to 10$/month for 
500mb more RAM, and then we got started.
</p><p>

I started setting up an Express framework on the server that would run our code, and 
while I was able to serve pages and route requests just fine, I could not figure out
how to make those async calls from my server to twitch. That was where our work stopped.
It's pretty frustrating, but I'm sure I'll figure it out. The challenge is taking code 
that worked in the browser and making it work on the server. I'm not sure when I'll 
work on this project again, but hopefully the answer comes easily when I start up again.
