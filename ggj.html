So on January 20th-22nd I ran UVic's 4th Global Game Jam. The two months leading 
up to the jam were probably the most stressful two months of my life. 
  </p>
  <p>
It started in mid-November when I was attending the third UVic GameDev Club meeting 
that I had been to so far - I was new to the group but interested in learing 
from some of the senior club members, who came off to me as having deep domain 
knowledge. I wanted to glean it from them, so I started attending their Thursday 
meetups. On the third meetup, they expressed that they had no one to organize their 
Global Game Jam. I stepped up and volunteered, because I want to get clout with them
and because I like to do lots of work and increase my baseline stress tolerance 
while I'm early in my career.

I got hooked up with Chris from IGDA Victoria and he helped me get a bunch of sponsorship
money right off the bat. Then I needed to put up a website for the jam, get a venue,
get volunteers, get more sponsorship, get prizes, get a tshirts, and all this other 
shit that took a fuckload of time. Chris was super helpful but I really was not 
prepared for the amount of effort this took. In the weeks before Christmas break, I
pulled many all nighters and drank waay too much coffee trying to get the site look 
good on mobile. I was scrambling to finish t-shirt designs and get a decent venue 
booked, and things were really proving hard to pull together. No one had a good 
venue for us, but we really didn't want to host the event on UVic campus.
  </p>
  <p>
It's really fucking stressful to have two people breathing down your neck at once.
Chris was on one side, trying to get me going with Game Jam organization, but on the
other side I had my co-op boss who knew nothing of me volunteering my time to 
organize a game jam. I had to write this big Ruby script that managed Yaml files 
before December 20th, and that was a huge bitch. I had some shell and some ruby 
working together, and things weren't going terribly smooth. I was working hard on 
the Ruby script and equally hard on the Game Jam but people still weren't happy 
on either side.
  </p>
  <p>
I ended up getting the script working at basically the very last minute. Fucking 
depressing. I also ended up getting chewed out by an Administrator of the Dean's 
office at UVic for trying to use some space in the Engineering Office Wing for our
game jam after trying and failing to get some 15+ downtown venues to host us.
That was really great, because it happened one week before the jam started. I 
managed to get some friends to pull some favours for me, and the jam did go off 
without a hitch. It was too damn close, though. I went through a huge rollercoaster 
of emotions, but I must say that at the end of it all, I felt damn good. I still
feel pretty good.
  </p>
  <p>
I still have shit to do for Chris, but since I'm done my co-op and I don't have to 
get Slack messages every day about shit that's not done yet, I'm really quite happy.
