  <h2>About Louis</h2>
  <h3>I'm a software engineer who likes to get his hands dirty.</h3>
  <p>
I grew up in a very small town in the interior of BC. I moved to Kamloops, BC 
when I was 18 to study Mathematics. At the end of my 2nd year, I decided to 
focus on software, and moved to Victoria in September, 2015.
I'm enrolled in, and am currently deferring, a Computer Science and Mathematics combined degree.
I've compeleted two co-op terms with Ruboss (makers of Leanpub) during April 2016 - December 2016.
I now work at Reelgood.com as a full-stack developer.
  </p>

  <p>
I write code in the Vim editor using the Dvorak key layout on a 
Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard.
  </p>

  <p>
I have a pretty intense personality that's rooted in a deep concern for the state 
of the planet. In particular, the greenhouse gas effect is very alarming to me: It 
could be that we are actively creating a future where 200 years from now the atmosphere 
is toxic. It could be that the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis'>clathrate gun</a> happens in the next 2-5 decades and kills 
a large swath of humanity. Maybe this won't happen to you in your lifetime, but what if it 
does, or it happens to your children?
  </p>

  <p>
Do you understand evolution intuitively? Can you appreciate how many people lived 
hunter-gatherer lives where there was no justice, no right to live, no decency and
no protection from the brutality of another human? Tool-wielding bi-pedal creatures 
have been around for 3,000,000 years at least. Suppose the average global population 
was 1,000,000 humans - A low guess. That means that three trillion humans have lived 
and died so that you could exist as the epitome of the bi-pedal mammal.
  </p>

  <p>
So here we are, sitting atop a genetic throne made from the suffering of three trillion 
men and women, rendering our planet unlivable for anyone born past 2100, let alone past 
that. And you're telling yourself that it won't happen in your lifetime, or your childrens, maybe.
But you are sitting on top of three million years of dead humans. Should they not have 
evolved for you? Should they not have built rudimentary tools, for they would not live to 
see the steam engine?
  </p>

  <p>
Of course, human nature is rooted in our common drives that drive survival of the fittest.
Have the prettiest wife. Win the most fights. Get the most food. Be the most 
popular. But - most important of all - Do not waste energy. Do not work when it is not 
necessary. Do not try when there is no immediate benefit to trying.
  </p>

  <p>
Thus, the great tradgedy of the Earth is the internal conflict of man in his fight for 
the future. Every human is born playing the game, and if every human lazily chooses 
to lose, then we all die ('lose' in the sense that you're relaxing and consuming
instead of eagerly advancing technology or policies that benefit humans). That's really all 
there is to life, in my opinion. That's the
real shit no one understands or wants to talk about.
  </p>

  <p>
  I believe that <a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rog.20004/pdf'>accelerated silicate weathering</a> as a global geo-engineering solution 
will play a big role in reducing atmospheric carbon levels, so my energy is focused 
on that in the long-term. In short, we need to crush and spread hundreds of cubic kilometers 
of silicate minerals per year every year to capture the carbon output of the globe.
My interest is in raising my personal capital to a level such that I can bootstrap 
commercially viable rock-crushing/mining ventures, as well as convince 
others to invest in my endeavors.
