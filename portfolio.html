		<h3>My Work at Reelgood</h3>

		<img src="reelgood.png" />
	
		<p>
			I was at Reelgood for one year.	I was one of five full time developers, and I worked predominantly on
			the front end. I worked on many major features:
		</p>

    <a href="https://reelgood.com/about">Reelgood - About</a><br/>
		<p>This is the Reelgood about page, where you see the value proposition of Reelgood displayed beautifully.
			The version you see is the version I created.</p>

    <a href="https://reelgood.com/all">Reelgood - All Content</a><br/>
		<p>This is the Reelgood all content page, which I created the first version of. It has since been reworked.</p>

    <a href="https://reelgood.com/sources">Reelgood - Sources</a><br/>
		<p>This is the Reelgood sources page, where you choose your sources. I wrote the first version,
			but it's since been reworked.</p>

    <a href="https://reelgood.com/account">Reelgood - Account (must be logged in to view)</a><br/>
		<p>This is the Reelgood account page. This was the first page that I created for Reelgood.</p>
	
		<p>
			In addition to these easily-visible pages, I created the main playback mechanism on Reelgood, which is a
			major feature. There is much more that I haven't listed, but to put it shortly, I touched nearly every part
			of the web app.
		</p>

		<h3>My Work at Leanpub</h3>

		<img src="leanpub-editors.png" />
	
		<p>
			I was at Leanpub for 8 months. I worked mostly on private projects. The public-facing areas of Leanpub 
			that I worked on were Leanpub for Publishers, and various areas of Leanpub's book publishing workflow.
		</p>

		<p>
			I wrote a lot of Ruby on Rails and React code for this job. I was writing components of large web apps 
			which included handling data, creating user interfaces, and styling them. The photo above showcases the 
			feature to add an editor, which I created. You used this feature to manage editors on a Leanpub Publisher 
			account.

		<h3>Global Game Jam, January 2017</h3>
		<img src="victoriaggj-site.png" />
		<p>
			Global Game Jam is a game development competition in which students get together with laptops and race
      to complete a game over a weekend. I did all the work to get this event off the ground.
			I raised enough money to feed 30 kids for two days,
			and did the web design and development. Here's some of the content produced for this event.

			I made six of the same thank-you website, and sent it off to the sponsors once the event was done.

		<p>
			I maintained the website for this event, as well as doing other event organization tasks. Here's the

		<h3>HackUVic, March 2018</h3>

		<h3>Krispy Chicken Chrome Extension, August 2016</h3>
		<img src="krispychicken.png" />
		<p>
			I worked with another student to create a Chrome extension that shakes up your browser window, replaces 
			all images with pieces of chicken, and adds rainbow background colours, for a laid-back hackathon called 
			Hack Some Crap.

    <h2>Some Other Software</h2>

		<h3>Graph Theory Demonstrator - Prim's Algorithm</h3>
		<img src="java.gif" />
		<p>
			This is a java application that demonstrates a Graph Theory concept. It's got a nice point-and-click, 
			drag-and-drop interface.

		<h3>C++ Battlesnake</h3>
		<p>
			This is a super-fast C++ Artificial intelligence algorithm. It's used to control a Battlesnake used 
			in SendWithUs's Battlesnake events.

		<h3>There's more to me than what you can see here, but these are the biggest projects that I've taken on.</h3>
		<p>Have a look at my github account to see more examples of code I've written. You'll also see many green 
			squares near the bottom of the page - those squares are there to show how much code I've written each day 
			of the past year. That should give the reader some confidence as to my ability to write code.</p>
