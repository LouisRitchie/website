  <h2>About Louis</h2>
  <p>
I grew up in a very small town in the interior of BC. I moved to Kamloops, BC 
when I was 18 to study Mathematics. At the end of my 2nd year, I decided to 
focus on software, and moved to Victoria in September, 2015.
Now I'm enrolled in a Computer Science and Mathematics combined degree, though
my interest is in software engineering.
I've compeleted two co-op terms with Ruboss (makers of Leanpub) during April 2016 - December 2016.
I code in Vim with the Dvorak layout on a 
Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard. 
My primary interest is becoming a better software engineer; I currently have no 
specialization beyond that, though my strength is in web software.
I'm also interested in growing student participation in tech events and 
helping student teams.
